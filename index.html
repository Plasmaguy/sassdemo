          <h1>We're on GitHub, baby!</h1>
          <p>Isn't it just crazy how much we can do with GitHub? We can do things like suffer through the command window, put all of our files in one place, make webpages from them, not understand what the hell a .yml is for, and not need to pay a dime! Of course, it can be a little bit of a hassle to set up (especially if you don't like the command line), but not if you have a guide! I am sort of running out of things to say here, so, why don't I throw random trivia at you?</p>

          <ul>
               <li>For a short period of time near the end of 2024, the Earth will have (or, if you're reading this a few months after publication, had) two moons as an asteroid got caught in its orbit.</li>
               <li>The smell of rain on dry grass is called petrichor (pronounced like pet-trick-CORE).</li>
               <li>McDonald's lost the trademark to the Big Mac in the European Union after overextending in a legal battle against a small restaurant chain called Supermac's.</li>
               <li>The meaning of life is 42.</li>
               <li>The exact number of characters in the index.html file of this page (not including line breaks or tabbing) is 1420.</li>
